<p> I am 50/50 Japanese and Korean. My father is Japanese and my mother is Korean, therefore I speak both Korean and Japanese as well as English. There are alot of conflicts these days within the two countries, so I usually have an identity crisis on a daily basis. <p/>

<p> One of my future goals is to become an airlines pilot for Japan airlines or Korean airlines. I would like to work for these airlines because of all the benefits of working with them, and to be able to travel for a living will be a great job for me in my opinion. <p/>

<p> Another life goal of mine is to attend the University of Tokyo for my undergraduate year. The reason why I chose this university is because I am intrested in the majors they offer, and most importantly the location, Tokyo, Japan.
